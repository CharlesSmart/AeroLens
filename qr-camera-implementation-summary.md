# QR Code Camera Implementation Summary

## Overview

We've implemented a feature that enables users to connect their phone via a QR code and use the phone's camera to take photos for use in the application. This implementation uses WebRTC for real-time communication between the main application and the phone.

## Components Created

1. **Serverless Function**
   - `api/signaling.ts`: Handles WebRTC signaling using Socket.IO

2. **UI Components**
   - `QRCodeModal.tsx`: Displays QR code for connecting phone
   - `PhoneCameraButton.tsx`: Button to trigger the QR code modal
   - `CameraPreview.tsx`: Displays the live camera feed from the phone
   - `MobileCameraPage.tsx`: Page that loads on the phone for camera access

3. **Type Definitions**
   - `simple-peer.d.ts`: TypeScript definitions for the simple-peer library

## Modified Components

1. **ImageUploader.tsx**
   - Added the Phone Camera button next to the Upload Image button

2. **EmptyState.tsx**
   - Added support for the onPhoneCameraConnected prop

3. **AnalysisPanel.tsx**
   - Added support for the onPhoneCameraConnected prop

4. **App.tsx**
   - Added state management for camera connection
   - Added handlers for camera connection, disconnection, and capture
   - Added the camera preview section

5. **main.tsx**
   - Added routing for the mobile camera page

## Configuration

1. **vercel.json**
   - Configured the serverless function for Vercel deployment

## How It Works

1. **Connection Establishment**
   - User clicks "Phone Camera" button
   - QR code is generated with a unique session ID
   - User scans QR code with phone
   - Phone opens the mobile camera page with the session ID
   - Signaling server connects the two devices

2. **Camera Stream**
   - Phone requests camera access
   - Camera feed is streamed to main app via WebRTC
   - Main app displays the live preview

3. **Photo Capture**
   - User clicks "Take Photo" button on main app
   - Capture command sent to phone
   - Phone captures high-resolution photo
   - Photo is sent to main app
   - Main app processes photo as a new profile

## Next Steps

1. **Testing**
   - Test on various devices and browsers
   - Verify camera access and permissions
   - Test photo capture functionality

2. **UI Refinement**
   - Improve error handling and user feedback
   - Enhance the mobile camera page UI
   - Integrate the camera preview more tightly with the main UI

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Optimize video stream quality
   - Improve connection reliability
   - Handle poor network conditions
